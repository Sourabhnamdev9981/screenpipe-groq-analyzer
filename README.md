# 🚀 ScreenPipe Groq Analyser

> Real-time productivity assistant using screen recordings and Groq’s powerful AI engine.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 13 – Build Real-Time Work Guidance Tools using ScreenPipe & Groq**

---

## 🎯 Objective

Our project aims to help developers, students, and professionals boost productivity by analyzing their screen activity in real time.  
Using ScreenPipe for capturing screen frames and Groq for ultra-fast inference, we deliver contextual suggestions, bug hints, and learning resources while you work.
